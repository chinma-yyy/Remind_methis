To recieve webhook requests you must have a Twitter develepor account with elevated access which grants you for 15 free subscriptions for your webhook.

To setup your webhook and subscription you may refer to this repository : [account-activity-dashboard](https://github.com/twitterdev/account-activity-dashboard)

Make sure to update all your keys with the required permissions with read write and direct message permissions.

As mentioned in the  [Twitter documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/account-activity-api/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks) you must host your application to recieve the request.

You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel your local host and recieve the webhook requests for development rather than hosting it.
